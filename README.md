# stimulus-detection

I simulate Poisson spike trains of one neuron, which has some baseline 
firing rate and a higher firing rate in response to a stimulus. I 
then use Baye's rule to determine the probability of a stimulus being
present using the probability density functions generated from simulated
data.
